University project demonstrating mechanical product design, prototyping and testing.

Create a sturdy, affordable, phone-compatible microscope base for PDMS lenses. This required innovation in design and a deep understanding of material properties and manufacturing processes to achieve both quality and cost-effectiveness.

In a team of two, we:
Conducted market research to understand the needs.
Generated concepts and selected the most feasible design.
Analyzed and evaluated the design for manufacturing and assembly.
Performed failure mode analysis and prototyping.
Developed financial models and explored patent options.
Conducted thorough testing on the final prototype.
Impact:

Our multi-faceted approach led to the creation of an innovative product that met affordability and functionality criteria, demonstrating our competence in mechanical design, prototyping, and real-world application.
