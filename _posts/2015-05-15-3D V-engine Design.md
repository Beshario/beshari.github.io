In this project, Part of the Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Course: I modelled some of the major internal components of a motorcycle V-engine. this helped me master the tools and techniques employed in a SOLIDWORKS automotive design project. Main components I have modelled are flywheel, connecting rods, valve, pistons, and sprockets.
