The need to understand and master the tools and techniques utilized in automotive design, specifically in modeling the internal components of a motorcycle V-engine.

As part of the Mechanical engineering final project, I used SolidWorks to model some of the major internal components of a motorcycle V-engine, including the flywheel, connecting rods, valve, pistons, and sprockets.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding and mastery of automotive design tools within SolidWorks. It facilitated hands-on experience with critical engine components, laying the groundwork for future engineering and design projects in the automotive field.
