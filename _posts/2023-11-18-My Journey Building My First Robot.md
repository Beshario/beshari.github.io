## Introduction

Ever since my high school days in a robotics competition, the idea of **applying physics to create** something phenomenal has captivated me. This led to my dream: **building a robot**. Not just a machine, but a **companion** that understands the nuances of life.

## The Inspiration

Post-layoff, I found myself with time - the most valuable resource. It was the perfect opportunity to bring my dream to life: **making my own robot**. It was about learning and establishing a **testing ground** for new ideas.

## Early Decisions and Designs

Starting with a mishmash of mechatronic parts, I set out to test autonomy and motor control. The plan? A robot powered by an **Arduino Uno board**, a motor driver hat, and a **Raspberry Pi**.

## Challenges with Everyday Components

The challenge was immediate. My parts were **limited**: stepper motors without encoders, no lidar, and an open-loop system. The need for the right equipment became glaringly apparent.

## Realization and Shift in Strategy

I faced a choice: continue with a limiting design or start afresh with a better solution. I chose the latter, focusing on **ROS2** - the current industry standard.

## Research and Component Selection

Back to the drawing board, I broke down the robot's systems. My focus was on **seamless integration** and **minimizing components**. I browsed through various projects to understand what worked for others.

## Building and Testing the Robot

The second version of my robot is underway. With a **modular design** in mind, it's evolving beyond my initial concept. This version boasts a DC motor with an encoder, an IMU, and a power bank.

## Reflections and Future Directions

Though still in progress, this journey has been an invaluable learning curve in **robotics and mechatronics**. It's a stepping stone to many more modular robot designs, aiming to **empower makers**.

## Conclusion

This experience has taught me that the journey in robotics is about **continuous learning and experimenting**. To those dreaming of building their own robot: start with what you have and learn as you go. The journey is challenging but rewarding.
