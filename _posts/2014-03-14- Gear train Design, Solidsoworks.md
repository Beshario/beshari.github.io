This project was part of the University of Ottawa's Machine Design Course. In a team of three, we designed a gear train that reduces the speed and amplifies the torque to be used in a cement mixer. The analysis included, shaft, gear, bearing and gear key analysis and sizing, all components had to be picked from existing catalogues.
