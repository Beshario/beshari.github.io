Udacity Robotics Software Engineer nanodegree is a 1-year program with two terms covering topics including perception, localization, path planning, control, Computer Vision, machine, and deep learning techniques for robot perception and behaviour. All this through the robotics operating system (ROS) with an introduction to robotic hardware systems. The program was in 2017
These are my implementation of the projects. The final report can be found in a pdf file in each of the following repositories.

1. [Udacity Robotics Perception Challenge](https://github.com/Beshario/Udacity-Robotics-Perception-Challenge)

    3D point cloud processing, segmentation and object recognition of table top items
2. [Robotic Arm Pick and Place](https://github.com/Beshario/Robotic-Arm-Pick-and-Place)

    Developing and integrating the inverse kinematic module and using it in pick and place operation of robotic arm,
3. [where am I](https://github.com/Beshario/WhereAmI)

    Robot model development, simulation and using amcl to localize within a known map.
4. [follow me](https://github.com/Beshario/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project)

    Training a FCN (SegNet) and deploying it to a drone in Unity, to follow a specific person in a crowd .
5. [Home service/delivery robot](https://github.com/Beshario/home-service-bot)

    Integrating different autonomy modules and using it to have the robot to predefined destinations in a map.
6. [Robot Search and sample return](https://github.com/Beshario/Robotics-Search-and-Sample-Return)

    Programming the image processing of a camera feed to threshold ground from sky, accumulating images and transforming them to a map, which is showing drivable terrain.
7. [Robotic Arm pick and place using deep reinforcement learning](https://github.com/Beshario/DRL-Robotics-Arm)

    training a convocational DQN agent in two-joint a robotic arm to touch an on-top of the table item. 
8. [SLAM](https://github.com/Beshario/SLAM-map-my-world)

    using RTAB-Map for slam in a kitchen environment, in Gazebo.


<!-- 
This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box. -->
