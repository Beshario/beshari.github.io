After my tenure (Sept 2019 - Oct 2021) at [*Allied Scientific Pro*](https://www.alliedscientificpro.com/) came to an end. I wanted to document some of the hardware and software projects I worked on:

### laser Cleaning system
The laser cleaning system is handheld device that shoots laser at a specific distance to de-coat materials. It has applied applications in various industries such as restoration, aerospace, automotive, and nuclear.

### Automating the laser Cleaning process
Proof of concept to automate the laser cleaning process using 3D sensors and a robotic arm, in scan-plan-execute fashion.  
The process is when you add an object to a table top, the robot will 3D-reconstruct the object and generate a tool path to clean the object. The robot will then executes the path to clean the object using the laser.

This project was funded externally at the end of proof of concept and moved to prototype phase.
