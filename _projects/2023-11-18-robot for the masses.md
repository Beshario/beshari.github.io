## Introducing the Accessible Robotics Project: Building Functional Robots with Minimal Parts

I'm excited to share a new initiative that's close to my heart: the **Accessible Robotics Project**. This project is born out of a simple yet powerful vision – to make robot-building accessible, functional, and achievable right from the comfort of your home.

## Why This Project Matters

In my journey through the world of robotics, detailed in my [BlogPost]({{site.baseurl }}/2023-11-18-My-Journey-Building-My-First-Robot/), I've discovered a gap in open-source projects. Many lack completion or functionality or sometimes just documentation, posing a barrier to enthusiasts and learners. This project aims to break down these barriers, offering a pathway to building your own robot with the least amount of complexity.

## Our Mission

- **Simplicity in Design**: Crafting robots that require minimal parts, making assembly straightforward and manageable.
- **Functional Open Source**: Developing open-source designs that result in fully functional robots, not just theoretical models.
- **Home-Friendly Robotics**: Ensuring that anyone with basic tools and resources can build these robots at home.
- **Empowering Creators**: Providing a platform for hobbyists, students, and robotics enthusiasts to learn, build, and innovate.

## The Journey Ahead

This isn't just about launching a project; it's about creating a movement. A movement where anyone, regardless of their technical background, can participate in robotics. I invite you to join me in this endeavor – to learn, to build, and to contribute.
