##### Allied Scientific Pro

Sept-2018- Oct-2021

Robotics research and development engineer.

- Developed and programmed the control software for autonomous robotic laser ablation work cell using
6-Dof robotic arms.
- Proved the concept and contributed algorithms, in C++, in a Linux environment for robot-based 3D
scanning, object segmentation, and tool path generation to provide real-time laser cleaning of serial
manipulators.
- Created simulations in Gazebo of the robot, environments and objects to test new algorithms and robot
behavior.
- Interfaced with different sensors, including RGB-D sensors, laser scanners and structured light sensors
and integrate them into the robotic system.
