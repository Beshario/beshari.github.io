During my tenure at [*Allied Scientific Pro*](https://www.alliedscientificpro.com/) from September 2019 to October 2021, I had the opportunity to work on several cutting-edge projects that pushed the boundaries of technology.

In this post, I will delve into the problems we addressed, the actions we undertook to resolve them, and the broader impact these solutions had on various industries.

### Laser Cleaning System

#### Problem
Traditional methods of material de-coating are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and may not be suitable for delicate applications in restoration, aerospace, automotive, and nuclear industries.

#### Action
i contributed to the mechanical design development of a handheld laser cleaning system that utilizes precise laser beams to target specific distances for de-coating materials.

</dev>
This innovation revolutionized the way materials are cleaned, providing a faster, more efficient, and delicate process, suitable for various industrial applications and used at Canada's parliament.

### Automating the Laser Cleaning Process

#### Problem
The manual laser cleaning process was marked by human error and inefficiencies. It required a solution that could add precision and automation to the process.

#### Action

Established automation projects for repetitive labour potential for clients teaching robots such as Yasakawa Motoman and Fanuc.

Led the automation R&D Project of automating the laser cleaning process using 3D sensors and a robotic arm. The proof of concept was successful and funded externally, moving to the prototype phase.

</dev>

Then I lead the sourcing and installation of a robotic arm, then the integration of Fanuc R-2000ic/210F with moveit.
This shows one of the tests I was performing.

#### Impact
The automated system pushed the boundary of automation, unfortunately I was not there long to witness the end of this potential project.

### Other Work

Different tasks for different projects. 

#### Action
- Developed 3D CAD designs, engineering drawings, and BOMs for LCS and robotic arm products.
- Integrated robotic arm and pneumatic systems.
- Designed, implemented, and tested safety systems.

</dev>

#### Impact
These projects strengthened our ability to deliver custom solutions to clients. They also helped us develop a better understanding of the challenges faced by various industries and how we can help them overcome these challenges.

### Single Event Effects (SEEs) Testing Station

#### Problem
The occurrence of single event effects in electronic components can lead to serious performance issues. A specialized system was required to test and mitigate these effects using a laser.

#### Action
- Managed the project custom work and production to completion.
- Implemented, deployed, and commissioned a specialized testing system for SEEs.
