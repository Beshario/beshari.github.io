As part of Ascension Automation Solutions, I had the chance to work on a project for ATS Industrial Automation, commissioning error-proofing inspection systems for GM’s battery lines. This was a significant and rewarding experience.

 It all started at ATS campus in Cambridge Ontario. I am introduced as a contrcator from the company I worked for -- Ascension Automation Solutions --. The company provides technical labour resources to other automatoin companies to integrate their equipemnt. Ascension AS also have their own manufacturing and integration products and services, located in Cambridge ON, Canada, where automation equipment is designed, built, tested and delivered to other customers.

#### Getting Started

My journey began at the ATS Industrial Automation campus, where I custom-built and developed the camera system for the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) before deployment. This initial phase was crucial for ensuring the system's performance and reliability. The camera were Matrox Cameras using Design assistant software. A powerful flowchart like software to program inspection systems based on widely available algorithims in the machine vision space.

#### Supervising Installation

Once on-site, I oversaw the installation of the hardware. Ensuring each component was correctly placed and securely mounted was critical. After that, even though boring yet necessary, was the verification of parts deliverd based on the design of ATS.

#### Hardware Setup

Next, I directed the experimental setup of the cameras and lighting. Adjusting angles, focus, and exposure to achieve optimal performance on the battery samples. During this phase, given dummy samples to us by GM, we optimized the camera inspeciton programs, camera direction and lighting to have a pass/fail inspection. I also programmed the web interface of the Matrox cameras, to be able to fine-tube inspection paramters on the fly to adapt the program on the variability of samples under test.

#### Troubleshooting

I encountered and resolved various issues, including cameras restarting randomly due to power issues, camera not saving inpsection images on the camera computer, and unreliable inspections with program updated. I also gained better practical PLC and HMI skills integrating, testing and validating various equipment such as stack lights, barcode readers, and torque controllers in manual stations.

#### Project Management

Aligning our actions with the plant’s deadlines required effective project management. Coordinating with teams, I ensured we met our timelines without compromising quality.

#### Collaboration

Working closely with Ascension and ATS teams, we fostered effective communication and teamwork, to drive the project to success.

#### Reflection

Successfully commissioning these systems was a milestone in my career, reinforcing my passion for automation and robotics. This project highlighted the transformative power of technology in the manufacturing space.

Taking the inspection system to a 100% reliable system was a eye-opening journey for myself. I strived for full automation, equipped with data and the desire to continously improve the system. It took a listening ear and eager heart, and that is something I am proud of in this journey.


#### Tools and Technologies Employed
- Utilized Windows Networking, Matrox Design Assistant, Keyance IX-Navigator, Studio 5000 (Allen Bradley PLC) and Siemens TIA portal

#### Conclusion

In the end, I am incredibly proud of the fully automated inspection system we developed and deployed. It stands as a testament to the power of collaboration, precision engineering, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. This achievement not only enhances manufacturing quality but also paves the way for future innovations in automation.
